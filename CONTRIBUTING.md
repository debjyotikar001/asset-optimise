# Contributing

If you find an issue, or have a better way to do something, feel free to open an issue, or a pull request. The package is far from perfect, and any help is welcome. There should be no contribution too small. All coding styles will be fixed during the pull request. So, don't worry too much about the code style. We are love to hear from you!

## How to contribute:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
- Make your changes and commit (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
- Create a pull request.

Thank you for considering contributing to AssetOptimise!
